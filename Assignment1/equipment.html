        <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <h2>What I Use</h2>
            <p>In 2022, I went to my local ski shop which was called "Proctor Ski and Board" during black friday to get my new equipment.
                 I bought both my snowboard and boots at this shop for a decent price.
                 The boots were definitely more expensive than the snowboard, however all the add ons to my snowboard ended up being a hefty sum with all my equipment totalling to almost $1500.
                 I also go to this shop to get all my equipment repaired and primed for the ski season, since it is conveniently close and cheap.
            </p>
            <h3>My Snowboard</h3>

            <p>My snowboard is the Rossignol District along with the Burton FS bindings attached to it.
                 It is measured at 159 Centimeters long, which rests at about the height of my chin.
                 There is such a big difference in using your own snowboard because the wax on the board is not worn out and the quality of the board is overall higher than the rentals.
                 By buying my own board I am also able to modify it as much as a like, which includes the binding straps, binding angles and looks of the board.
                 I plan to buy grip tape to put on my board for when I am not strapped into the binding on my loose foot.
                 Your non-dominant foot is called the loose foot or pushing foot because when we are trying to move around at the bottom of the hill, we unstrap our loose foot to push ourselves wherever we need to go.

            <h3>My boots</h3>
            <img src="images/IMG_2313.jpg" alt="MyBoots">
            <p>My boots are the thirtytwo Shifty Boas
                 I dislike using the boots where I need to tie laces because they get undone very easily.
                 So instead I bought the Boa because I can just screw the Boa on the front of the boot to tighten the boot.
                 It is very convenient and easy to get into because of the Boa allowing me to tighten it very quickly.
                 The comfortability of the boots are very nice too and they are light so moving around in the boots is not a pain at all compared to other boots.
                 I used to trip over my laces when using rental boots all the time.
