            <h2>Written Reviews</h2>
                <h3>Pat's Peak</h3>
                <p>This is the mountain I am the most familiar with.
                 I have been going here ever since I was in middle school and it has over 15 trails with various difficulties and terrain.
                 Definitely one of my favorite places to ski.
                </p>
                <h3>Cannon Mountain</h3>
                <p>
                 This is the biggest mountain I have been to with many of the courses being very long and taking me over 20 minutes to complete one trail.
                 Despite this being the mountain I fractured my arm at, I very much enjoyed my experience at this location, though it was unofortuante that it was icy that day I went snowboarding.
                 They also have a very cool waterpark in their resort.
                </p>
                <h3>Elk Mountain</h3>
                <p>
                 I went here for two days to snowboard and I thoroughly enjoyed snowboarding with my friends.
                 The food here was very good as well and the resting cabin was very large and cozy.
                 The food was a little pricy though.
                 Slightly smaller than the formerly mentioned mountains but still had many trails to offer.
                </p>
                <h3>Mcintyre Ski Area</h3>
                <p>I went here because they were doing a deal for $20 tickets, however there was only one small hill to ride down.
                 Personally I don't think it was worth the price because of how small the area was.
                </p>
