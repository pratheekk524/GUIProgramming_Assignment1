        <h1>Experiences</h1>
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>I first started snowboarding when I was in 6th grade through my school's ski program.
                     A funny story is that I actually wanted to ski originally because a girl I liked at that time was skiing.
                     However when I told my dad I wanted to ski, he picked snowboarding instead saying that snowboarding would be more likely to impress her.
                     Funnily enough, I ended up liking snowboarding more than her.
                     I had originally planned to snowboard alongside her but I ended up making more friends who snowboarded and rode alongside them instead.
                     Ever since my first year of snowboarding, I knew that it was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
                     Within my first year, I quickly mastered the basics, so quickly in fact that the instructors moved me up to a higher difficulty class.
                     I had continued going every winter season to continue mastering more challenging concepts in snowboarding until high school.</p>
                <h3>My Injury</h3>
                <p>I tried to continue snowboarding through high school, so I signed up for my school's ski club.
                     During one of our ski trips I had numerous small falls on the icy mountain, which all contributed me to fracturing my arm.
                     Back when I first started, my mother was against me snowboarding because she hated me doing dangerous activities.
                     So when I got back from the trip and told her that I hurt my arm she took me to get it checked out and I found out my arm was fractured.
                     When my mom heard what the doctor said, she was very upset that I hurt myself while snowboarding, so much so that I was barred from doing it for many years.</p>
                <h3>The Return</h3>
                <p>Once I got to college, I decided to finally get back into snowboarding.
                     My freshman year I went snowboarding for the first time in years with my college friends.
                     I was very rusty when I did it, however within a few hours I started to pick it up again.
                     Riding a snowboard once again made me very excited and I realized that I still enjoyed snowboarding very much.
                     The following year I went to get my own equipment for myself so that I wouldnt have to rent equipment anymore.
                     I spent almost $1500 however I now have my own equipment that I can use, the fact that I had equipment of my own made me very glad,
                     especially since my old ones from middle school are way too small for me now.</p>
                <h3>Pennsylvania Trip</h3>
                <img src="images/IMG_2004.jpg" alt="MySnowboard">
                <p>On February of 2024, my friend Chakshu and I drove down to meet our friend Matthew in Pennsylvania to snowboard together.
                     We spent the weekend in Matthew's home and we snowboarded at a local ski resort.
                     This ski resort was a little smaller than the ski resort that I snowboard at usually, but the view there was amazing.
                     More than anything I enjoyed snowboarding with my friends and it was great to see Matthew since he lives so far away.</p>
