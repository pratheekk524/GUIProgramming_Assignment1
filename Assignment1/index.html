            <p>Hello and welcome to the main page of my website! I am Pratheek Kotamarti, a 4th year student at UMass Lowell studying computer science.
                 This is my first website that I am creating and I decided to make it into a sort of journal of my hobby of snowboarding.
                 I hope you enjoy reading this snowboarding journal and hopefully it inspires you to try snowboarding as well if you haven't already! 
            </p>
            <p>Funfact: My favorite season is winter because I love shredding mountains with my snowboard.</p>
